# RAWviewer Release Notes

## 🚀 Version 2.2.0
**Release Date: May 30, 2026**

🎯 What's New
- **Search from single-image view**: Search button in single view; submitting a query switches to gallery with filtered results.
- **Fast single-file open**: Opening one image no longer waits for full folder scan and EXIF sort on large libraries.

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **Gallery refresh after EXIF sort**: Gallery auto-updates when background capture-time refinement completes.
- **Search navigation**: Film strip and arrow keys stay within active search results until the filter is cleared.

## 🚀 Version 2.1.0
**Release Date: May 28, 2026**

🎯 What's New
- **Film strip (single-image view)**: Bottom thumbnail strip on pointer hover; dismisses when leaving the strip or entering the status bar.
- **Launch scripts**: Debug and build entry points moved to `scripts/Launch/` (`bat/` on Windows, `shell/` on macOS); root scripts forward for compatibility.
- **Semantic + face indexing (Windows)**: Phased indexing (metadata → MobileCLIP embeddings → background face backfill), resume from `semantic_index.db`, DirectML-accelerated ONNX on Windows when available.

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **Installer model download**: Added `requests` to Pixi dependencies so `huggingface_hub` can download MobileCLIP ONNX models on first install (no HF account required for public models).
- **Indexing stability**: Stronger RAW thumbnail fallbacks, skip permanently unindexable files, conservative face-scan warm-up defaults, clearer progress phases.
- **Delete confirmation dialog**: Centered on the main window using global coordinates.
- **Face detection threshold**: YuNet / SSD confidence raised to **0.75** (fewer false positives).
- **Logging**: Persistent logs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RAWviewer\logs\`; installer no longer bundles old `src/logs`.
- **Dependencies**: `pixi.toml` is the source of truth; legacy `requirements.txt` removed.
- **Docs**: Pixi-first build instructions, minimum macOS 13 for prebuilt releases.

Includes fixes from **2.0.1** (Pixel DNG, gallery aspect ratio, DNG single-view zoom).

## 🚀 Version 2.0.1
**Release Date: May 23, 2026**

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **Google Pixel DNG Support**: Fixed critical crashes in the `QImageReader` and `EXIFExtractor` fallbacks that prevented Google Pixel DNG files from rendering on macOS.
- **Gallery Aspect Ratio Fix**: Fixed a bug where thumbnail crops were improperly bypassed, ensuring that all gallery tiles now correctly display cropped square previews without distorted aspect ratios or zoomed-in glitches.
- **DNG Single-View Zoom Stability**: Reworked DNG single-image loading to use a full-resolution-first path and tightened pending zoom-state handling, fixing intermittent cases where Space / double-click changed zoom status text without actually zooming the image.

## 🚀 Version 2.0.0
**Release Date: May 7, 2026**

🎯 What's New
- **Local Semantic Search**: Cross-platform natural-language gallery search. Harness the power of MobileCLIP (Core ML on macOS, ONNX on Windows) to rank images by meaning (e.g., "sunny landscape" or "vintage portrait").
- **Structured Metadata Filters**: Powerful new query syntax to narrow by `camera:`, `lens:`, `iso:`, `ext:`, and more.
- **Slideshow Mode**: Automatic hands-free playback of your photos with adjustable intervals.
- **macOS Native Share**: Integration with the native macOS share sheet for instant sending via Mail, AirDrop, or Messages.
- **High-Fidelity Rendering**: New LANCZOS resampling and 2x JPEG oversampling for razor-sharp display on 4K and Retina screens.
- **Native macOS & Windows Shell Integration**: Improved Windows shell verbs and deep Finder/Explorer compatibility.
- **Non-Destructive Rotation**: Instantly rotate any image (including RAW) by 90° steps visually without modifying the original file.
- **Massive Location Intelligence**: Added ~150+ world cities to the GPS contradiction filter and improved multi-word place detection (e.g., "Hong Kong").
- **Precision Focus Overlays**: Added focus point visualization using MakerNote data for Canon, Nikon, and Sony.

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **High-Quality RAW Fallback**: Automatically triggers high-quality "fast RAW decode" for files with poor-quality embedded previews.
- **Performance Hardening**: Refactored `UnifiedImageProcessor` to open RAW files exactly once, drastically reducing Disk I/O.

### ⌨️ Keyboard & Gesture Map
- **Space / Double-click**: Toggle between "Fit to Window" and 100% zoom.
- **Pinch-to-Zoom**: Smoothly zoom in/out via trackpad or Ctrl+Scroll Wheel.
- **Left / Right Arrow**: Navigate between images (preserves zoom level).
- **Down Arrow**: Move current image to "Discard" folder.

🛠️ Fixes & improvements

- **Live Status Feedback**: Real-time zoom percentage and total image counts displayed in the status bar.
