## Test Execution

### Running Individual Test Suites

Each test suite can be run independently:

```bash
# Run main test suite
python tests/test_suite.py

# Run RAW format compatibility tests
python tests/raw_format_compatibility_test.py

# Run keyboard shortcuts tests
python tests/keyboard_shortcuts_test.py

# Run edge case tests
python tests/edge_case_test.py

# Run performance tests
python tests/performance_test.py
```

### Running All Tests

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python tests/run_all_tests.py
```

This will:
- Execute all test suites in sequence
- Generate individual reports for each test suite
- Create a master QA report
- Provide summary statistics

## Test Requirements

### Dependencies

The test suite requires the following Python packages:

```
PyQt6          # GUI framework
rawpy          # RAW image processing
psutil         # System and process monitoring
numpy          # Numerical operations
natsort        # Natural sorting
send2trash     # Safe file deletion
```

### Test Data

Tests create temporary files and folders automatically. No external test data is required.

## Expected Results

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Startup Time**: < 5 seconds
- **File Scanning**: < 2 seconds for typical folders
- **Zoom Toggle**: < 0.1 seconds per operation
- **Navigation**: < 0.05 seconds per image
- **Memory Usage**: < 200MB initial, reasonable growth with large files
- **CPU Usage**: < 80% during intensive operations

### RAW Format Support

#### Primary Support (Expected to work well)
- ✅ Canon CR2, CR3
- ✅ Nikon NEF
- ✅ Sony ARW, SRF
- ✅ Adobe DNG
- ✅ Olympus ORF
- ✅ Panasonic RW2
- ✅ Pentax PEF

## Known Limitations

### RAW Processing
- Relies on `rawpy` library capabilities
- Some specialized formats may have limited support
- Processing speed depends on file size and system performance

### Memory Usage
- Large RAW files (>100MB) may consume significant memory
- Memory usage depends on image dimensions and bit depth
- Garbage collection may be needed for extended use

### Platform Compatibility
- Tests designed for Windows environment
- Some file operations may behave differently on other platforms
- Path handling uses Windows-style paths

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Python path configuration
   - Verify PyQt6 installation

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Run with appropriate permissions
   - Check file and folder access rights
   - Ensure write access to temp directories

3. **Display Issues**
   - Ensure display/X11 forwarding is available
   - Check for virtual display requirements
   - Verify GUI framework initialization

### Test Failures

If tests fail:
1. Check the detailed error output
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure sufficient system resources
4. Check for interference from other applications
5. Review test logs for specific error messages
