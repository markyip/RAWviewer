## ‚úàÔ∏è Why This Exists
You're an aviation photographer who just returned from RIAT or spent a day at the Mach Loop. You took thousands of RAW shots of fast jets, helicopters, and flybys ‚Äî and now you're facing the real challenge:

- You want to **sort through all your photos** and identify the best shots.
- Tools like **Lightroom** or **Capture One** are powerful, but importing and checking each image is **time-consuming**.
- The default **Windows Photos** viewer lets you browse, but:
  - It's clunky with RAW files.
  - You have to zoom in manually to check sharpness.
  - There's no easy way to filter out blurry images.

I've been there myself ‚Äî I still haven't finished editing my **500GB of RIAT 2024 photos** because of how tedious this process is. That frustration is exactly what inspired me to build **RAWviewer**.

RAWviewer is a lightweight, focused image viewer built specifically for photographers who shoot a lot ‚Äî especially in aviation, wildlife, or sports.

- Instant file previewing: No import steps ‚Äî just drag & drop.
- Zoom in with a single key to check sharpness immediately.
- Stay in zoomed mode while browsing with arrow keys.
- Quickly remove blurry photos from the queue with `‚Üì` (moves them to a discard folder).
- No complex controls to memorize ‚Äî just the essential keys to move fast.

This is a **pre-filtering tool**, letting you go through hundreds of RAW files efficiently **before** committing to editing them in Lightroom or Photoshop.
