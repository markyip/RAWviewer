## üß™ Testing

The application includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/run_all_tests.py

# Run specific test suites
python tests/test_suite.py              # Core functionality
python tests/raw_format_compatibility_test.py  # Format support
python tests/keyboard_shortcuts_test.py # Input handling
python tests/edge_case_test.py          # Edge cases
python tests/performance_test.py        # Performance
```

## üìä Performance

### Typical Performance
- **Startup Time**: < 5 seconds
- **Image Loading**: 1-3 seconds (depends on file size)
- **Navigation**: < 0.05 seconds between images
- **Memory Usage**: 100-200MB base, +100MB per large RAW file

### Optimization Tips
- **SSD Storage**: Faster image loading from solid-state drives
- **RAM**: More RAM allows handling larger RAW files
- **CPU**: Multi-core processors improve RAW processing speed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start**
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Check all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try running from command line to see error messages

**RAW files won't open**
- Verify the file format is supported (see [`SUPPORTED_FORMATS.md`](SUPPORTED_FORMATS.md))
- Check if the file is corrupted
- Ensure sufficient RAM for large files

**Performance issues**
- Close other applications to free memory
- Move images to faster storage (SSD)
- Reduce image file sizes if possible

**Keyboard shortcuts not working**
- Click on the main window to ensure it has focus
- Check if other applications are capturing the same shortcuts
